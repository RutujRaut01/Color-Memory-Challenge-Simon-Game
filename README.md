**🎮 Simon Game Project**

This project is a digital recreation of the classic **Simon Game** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. 🖥️ Players are challenged to memorize and repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors. Each round, the game randomly adds a new color to the sequence 🎨, and players must click the buttons in the correct order to advance to the next level. 🚀

**✨ Key Features:**
- **🌐 Responsive UI:** Designed with HTML and CSS to provide a sleek, interactive layout.
- **💡 Dynamic JavaScript Logic:** Manages game sequences, tracks user clicks, and checks the correctness of each round.
- **🔊 Audio-Visual Feedback:** Every button press is accompanied by sound and animations, enhancing the gameplay experience.
- **⬆️ Difficulty Progression:** The sequence grows with each level, adding excitement and challenge. If players make a mistake, a “game over” animation and sound play.

This Simon game combines the fun of a classic memory challenge with the power of JavaScript to create engaging web content.
